<h3 class="section-heading">FIRST is more than just robots; it’s an international family.
</h3>

<p>
    Hello! It is Arda here. I began discovering robotics when I joined the robotics club at my school in grade 9. It was a general club that anyone could join. However, that wasn’t the case for the FLL (FIRST Lego League) teams. FLL is another competition organized by FIRST, but it’s simpler, with students using Legos and block programming to complete their robot. These teams had a limit of 10 people per team. Initially, our mentor decided to have two teams, and I wasn’t included. 

</p>

<p>
    One day, after a general meeting, my two friends and I were the only ones who stayed to tidy up our desk, which was full of Legos and components. Those 5-10 minutes changed my life significantly. Our mentor decided to set up a third team and included the three of us, along with seven other members, just because of our behaviour.
</p>

<p>
    Although classes were online, we were going to school at least four days a week for robotics. We even had to get special permits to avoid the COVID lockdown, just to make robots! We worked alongside the other two teams and helped each other whenever we could. One of our teams became the local champion out of 26 teams! We also earned second place in the Core Values category. We had a great team structure and were able to organize many events and competitions ourselves! So, we weren’t just building robots; we were contributing to our local community in ways we couldn’t have imagined before. Some of the events we organized included:
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meetings with other teams around Turkey</li>
        <li>Makey Makey training for preschool children</li>
        <li>Animation training and competition</li>
        <li>Meetings and discussions with athletes from various fields</li>
        <li>Valorant competitions</li>
        <li>And many more!</li>
      </ul>
      
</p>

<p>
    Through FLL, I then had the chance to join the FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) team in grade 10. FRC was far more complicated and serious. The robots seemed huge to me.

<p>
    Our team had three sub-teams: mechanical, programming, and PR (Public Relations). I remember feeling insecure and scared at first. Our team was really inexperienced and I was the head of programming. The mechanical team had high expectations that we didn’t yet know how to meet. The stress I felt pushed me to work harder than ever. We went to our first competition only two months after I joined the team. We placed 10th out of 29 teams and made it to the quarterfinals as an alliance leader. It was a good achievement for the first time.
</p>

<p>
    After learning more about how things worked in the competition and how fun it was, I started liking FIRST even more. Following that competition, I would spend my 10-minute breaks in the robotics room, trying to make the robot do something cool. In a normal FRC season, the programming team gets around 1-2 weeks to code the robot, so we had to be really efficient. But since this was off-season, I had no problem spending time on new things. Once, I installed a crash-protection system, and the whole team got to play around with it! In my second competition, we ranked 5th out of 43 teams, which was much better than we expected.
</p>

<p>
    I also got to do many other things with my FRC team. We participated in different hackathons and raised more than $1,000 for the team. I even met a famous voice actor at one of the competitions and did a short interview with him live.
</p>

<p>
    Then, in grade 11, I moved to Canada. I searched for a team here and asked to join a school team, even though I wasn’t attending that school. They happily accepted me, and I attended two other competitions with them. It was hard for me to travel, so the next year I transferred to that school, for robotics!

</p>

<p>
    So you see, that’s why I said FIRST is like an international family where everyone is welcome when they put in the effort. I have moved to a new continent, but it is still there for me, providing a space where I can work with like-minded people.
</p>

<p>
    My experience in FIRST has helped me improve my confidence, social and teamwork skills, management skills, and much more! I wish everyone in the world had the chance to have that kind of experience in secondary school. The lack of FTC teams in the Ottawa area is a barrier, but hopefully, my friend Thoufeek and I can create room for another 8-10 kids and help them improve their abilities beyond their expectations.
</p>

<p>
    You’re probably wondering what the competition and structure look like! The robots we’ll make will not be as big as the FRC robots but they’ll still be quite impressive! We’re having a quick presentation and a Q&A session! We’ll post the details soon. Hope to see you!
