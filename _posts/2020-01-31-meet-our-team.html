    We are a team of passionate college students, driven by curiosity and a deep fascination with robotics. Our mission is to lead our peers in exploring the vast world of technology, where we can push the boundaries of innovation together.
 </p>

 <p>
    In mid-2024, we embarked on this journey with the goal of competing in the First Robotics Challenge, one of the most prestigious robotics competitions in the world. Although we are still in the early stages, our vision is clear: to create groundbreaking projects that not only showcase our technical prowess but also inspire others to see the limitless possibilities within the realm of robotics.
 </p>

 <p>
    Through persistence, perseverance, and a proactive mindset, we aim to make a significant impact in the field of robotics, bringing our ideas to life and contributing to the future of technology. Our journey has just begun, but our commitment to excellence and innovation is unwavering.

<h2 class="section-heading">The Foundation</h2>

<p>
   We base everything we do on first-principle thinking. That means we take complex problems, break them down to their core elements, and then put them back together in fresh, innovative ways. This process not only helps us understand things better but also boosts our creativity and sharpens our problem-solving abilities.
